## Introduction

Simple PHP CMS is a lightweight, file-based Content Management System. It's designed to be easy to set up and use, without the need for a database.

It is completely open source; community involvement is highly encouraged.

If you wish to contribute ideas or code, please feel free to make pull requests to our Github repository.

## Requirements

* PHP 5.6 or higher
* A web server (Apache, Nginx, etc.)

## Install

1. **Download the code:** Place the `index.php` file in a new folder on your web server.
2. **Create a `content` folder:** Inside the same folder, create a new folder named `content`.
3. **Set the admin password:** In the `index.php` file, change the `ADMIN_PASSWORD` constant to a secure password.
